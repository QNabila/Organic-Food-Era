        <h3>
        Chimichurri Sauce
        </h3>
        <p>
        Compared to pesto, chimichurri has a bright taste that let’s the herbal flavors of cilantro and parsley shine strong. The taste is complimented nicely with a tangy lift of lime and the rich flavor of olive oil. You can adjust (or leave out) the amount of jalapeno depending on your tolerance for spicy food. I tend to find chimichurri sauces a little too strong when raw white onion is added. so I use a red onion. This adds more sweetness and less of a bite.

        <h3>
            Tenderloin Steak
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ideally, you should not marinate a steak for more than 24 hours — especially if you have a tender cut of steak.  Any longer than that and the muscle fibers will break down and the texture will become mushy.Some types of steak, like skirt steak, are naturally not very tender and should be left to marinate for a longer time in order to tenderize. For tougher cuts of beef.

        <h3>
            THAI TOMATO SOUP
        </h3>
        <p>
            This Thai tomato soup is the perfect dish for these late summer days when tomatoes are still abundant at the farmers market, but the weather is just starting to dip into the 60s. I was feeling inspired after seeing this recipe from Bon Appetit for bruised tomato and bread soup. I have the tendency to buy a few too many tomatoes at the market, so I had a couple extra around to use in this soup.

        <p>The Zucchini Lasagna is the perfect recipe. You can also make smaller lasagna in dollar store foil pans and freeze for later. Bake when needed. You can probably get three smaller lasagna out of this recipe.</p>
